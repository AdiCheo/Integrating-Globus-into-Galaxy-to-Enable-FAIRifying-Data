# Integrating-Globus-into-Galaxy-to-Enable-FAIRifying-Data

## Goals

Things we'd like to get out of this hackathon

* A how to on setting up Galaxy using Globus Auth

* A Galaxy Tool template that can get securely get tokens from a userâ€™s Galaxy environment (I.e., without using a stored database password)

* A Galaxy tool for Transfer with inputs and outputs for endpoints and paths. We want this tool to end up in the Galaxy toolshed.

* Either another tool or the same one to create folders and set permissions on a shared endpoint, similar to things we do in the [Globus automation examples](https://github.com/globus/automation-examples/)

* Sample workflows to use these.

## FAIRness

[FAIRshake](https://fairshake.cloud) has different rubrics, the [tool rubric](https://fairshake.cloud/rubric/7/) seems the most appropriate.
